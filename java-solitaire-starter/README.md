# Java Solitaire (Console)

This project is a fully playable console-based implementation of Klondike Solitaire written in Java. 
It is designed with clean object-oriented principles and runs entirely in the terminal, making it easy 
to build, run, and extend using VS Code or any standard Java environment.

The game models real Solitaire rules, including card movement validation, pile-specific constraints, 
and win condition detection. The project emphasizes clarity, maintainability, and correctness over 
graphical complexity.
